# PDRO
The Prescription of Drugs Ontology

PDRO is a realist ontology that aims to represent the domain of drug prescriptions. PDROâ€™s central focus is the structure of a drug prescription, which is represented as a mereology of informational entities. Our current use cases are (1) refining this structure (e.g., adding closure axioms, cardinality, datatype bindings, etc) for prospectively standardizing local electronic prescriptions and (2) annotating prescription data of differing EHRs for detecting inappropriate prescriptions using a central semantic framework.
